Categorical predictors should be CategoricalVectors\n\nKeywords\n\nfeatures: Either:\nA Vector of AbstractFeatureClass type features; or\nA string where \"l\" = linear and categorical, \"q\" = quadratic, \"p\" = product, \"t\" = threshold, \"h\" = hinge; or\nNothing, in which case the default features based on the number of presences are used\nregularization_multiplier: A constant to adjust regularization, where a higher regularization_multiplier results in a higher penalization for features\nregularization_function: A function to compute a regularization for each feature. A default regularization_function is built in.\naddsamplestobackground: A boolean, where true adds the background samples to the predictors. Defaults to true.\nn_knots: the number of knots used for Threshold and Hinge features. Defaults to 50. Ignored if there are neither Threshold nor Hinge features\nweight_factor: A Float64 to adjust the weight of the background samples. Defaults to 100.0.\nbackend: Either LassoBackend() or GLMNetBackend(), to use Lasso.jl or GLMNet.jl fit the model.\n\nLasso.jl is written in pure julia, but can be slower with large model matrices (e.g. when hinge is enabled).
